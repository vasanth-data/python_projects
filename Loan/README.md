**Project Title:** Loan Portfolio Analysis and Default Behavior Study

**Description:**

The loan portfolio analysis and default behavior study project aim to perform thorough analysis of borrower data within a loan portfolio dataset using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization, respectively. The dataset contains various attributes related to borrowers and their loans, including the amount pending, tenure, interest rate, city, bounce behavior, disbursed amount, and loan number.

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of this project is to provide insights into borrower behavior and default patterns within the loan portfolio. By analyzing the provided attributes, the project seeks to understand factors contributing to borrower default and identify potential risk factors associated with loan disbursements.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Exploration:** Conduct extensive data exploration to understand the characteristics of the loan portfolio. This includes analyzing the distribution of loan amounts, tenure, interest rates, and bounce behavior across different states and cities.

2. **Visualization:** Utilize matplotlib to create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to depict the distribution of loan attributes and identify correlations between variables. Visualizations will aid in gaining insights into borrower behavior patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Preprocess the dataset using pandas to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and create new features that may contribute to default prediction. Feature engineering will enhance the quality of the dataset for analysis.

4. **Bounce Behavior Analysis:** Analyze bounce behavior patterns of borrowers using pandas to understand the frequency and timing of bounce incidents since loan disbursal. This analysis will provide insights into borrower payment behavior and potential risk indicators.

5. **Statistical Analysis:** Perform statistical analysis using pandas to calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for loan attributes. Statistical analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of the loan portfolio data.

Overall, the project aims to provide valuable insights into borrower behavior and default patterns within the loan portfolio dataset using data analysis techniques with pandas and visualization methods with matplotlib.
